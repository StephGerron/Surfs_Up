# Surfs Up!

## Exploring key differences between the June and December temperature data.

### We have many data points from June and December. The mean of both months shows the average temperature in these months is very close, not even four degrees different. This shows the surf shop has a seemingly very stable temperature from Summer to Winter.  Very stable upper temperatures, with only an eight degree, spread for the minimum of both months and maximum only have a two degree difference. 


## Recommendations for further analysis.

### A similar analysis should be done on percipitation, this will also affect traffic in a surf and ice cream shop. 

### Another analysis could be done on tourist and population numbers per islands as well. Where most people vacation or has the biggest draw to the beach is also another key factor to include in further analysis. If not other islands, definitely the different beaches in Oahu. 

### Lastly, a look at what tourists could need or want at the beach and what will bring locals to the shop would very beneficial to make sure choices for the shop is on the current trend.
