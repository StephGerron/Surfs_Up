# Surfs Up!

## Exploring key differences between the June and December data.

### We have a good amount of data points from June and December. The mean of both months shows the average temperature in these months is very close, not even four degrees different. This shows the surf shop has a seemingly very stable temperature from Summer to Winter.  Very stable upper temperatures, with only an eight degree, spread for the minimum of both months and maximum only have a two degree difference.
